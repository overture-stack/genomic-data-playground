# <a name="docker-host-and-container-path-mappings"></a>Docker host and container path mappings
Since all clients and services communicate through a docker network, any files from the docker host that are to be used with the clients must be mounted into the docker containers. 
Similarly, any files that need to be output from the containers to the docker host must also be mounted. Since these files are not apart of this repository, they can be located in the `./scratch` directory.
This has already been pre-configured in the `docker-compose.yml`. 
The following represent the docker host path to docker container path mappings:

**NOTE:** All file paths below are relative to the root directory of this repository.

| Host path | Container path | Description |

| ./song-example-data             | /song-client/input   | Contains example files for submitting to Song and uploading to Score. Used by the `song-client` and `score-client` |
